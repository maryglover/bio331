## Helpful Resources

As we go through the semester, I will add useful resources here. 

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is an excellent introduction and resource for using R software for data analysis. This is a free online textbook. 
- [Data Science in R: A Gentle Introduction](https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/getting-started-in-r.html)
