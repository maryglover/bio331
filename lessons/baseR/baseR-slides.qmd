### What is R?

R is a free, open source computing *software* used for statistical analysis and graphing. R is also a computing *language*. This means that R software interprets the R language, which is a specific set of vocabulary, formatting, and structure, to perform specific tasks. Other coding languages are Java, C++, python, etc.

## R: Why are we using it?

----------

### R is reproducible

- Writing code allows you to keep record of methods. 
- Researchers can share code, allowing methods to be repeated

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Organize and manage data

```{r, echo = F}

rhago <- read.csv('~/Dropbox/M/Rhagoletis/SDM/clean-data/full_sdm_data.csv')
rhago

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Organize and manage data

```{r, echo = T}

library(dplyr)
rhago %>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  summarize(N = n())

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### R is a marketable skill in many disciplines

R is used by many big companies
Which companies use R?
Here are just a few of the big-name companies that use R in their tech stack:

- Bank of America
- Amazon
- Facebook
- Google
- IBM
- Uber
- The New York Times

--------------

### New York Times used R to make senate predictions

## What is Rstudio?

Rstudio is an interface that runs the R software in a user friendly format. Rstudio allows the user to run R code, take notes, view graphs, and view files in one window.

---------------------------------------------------

### Other type of code can also be run in Rstudio

### We are using Posit Cloud

You can access your Posit Cloud account on any computer. 

This will be convenient for this class because you are able to work on projects in class and then go home and access your work on your on computer by logging in to your account. 

---

### R projects

- A project is a essentially a folder where you complete an R project. 
- In Posit Cloud, all work is organized in projects.
- A project contains all your work is contained, including data files, notes, etc. 

<span style="color:blue">**Open the *Learn R* project in the class workspace **</span>

When you open the project, you should see three main panes.

### Tips for naming files and directories

-   R is case sensitive! So be aware of your capitalization
-   Do *not* use spaces in your names. If you would like to separate words you can use "\_" or "-"
-   Pay attention to file extensions (i.e. .jpg, .pdf, .txt). You will need to use full name when working with files.
-   Folders in names are separated by "/". So for example the directory "Documents/bio_files" is a folder "bio_files" inside the folder "Documents." "Documents/bio_files/photosynthesis.pdf" Is a PDF file inside the bio_files folder.
