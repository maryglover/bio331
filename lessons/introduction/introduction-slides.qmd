## Google Chat Workspace

![](slide-images/gchat.png)

We will use the course chat workspace for questions and help during class. This is a great place to share code when needed.

[**Homework**: Make a post in the class google chat]{style="color:blue"}.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Posit Cloud

![](slide-images/posit-cloud-logo.png)

We will complete coding exercise on the website posit Cloud. You will receive a link to our class workspace soon!

[**Homework**: Make a Posit Cloud Account]{style="color:blue"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Google Docs and Slides

For writing assignments, students must complete work in a shared google document or google slideshow. Many of the writing assignments will be worked on throughout the semester. This will help emphasize the writing process.

## Course survey

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is science and the scientific method?

::: incremental
-   "Hypothesis testing"
-   Scientific inquiry uses well-established methods to test hypotheses.
-   A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a natural phenomenon.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ![understandingscience.org](slide-images/scientific-method.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scientific articles

![](slide-images/scientific_articles.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scientific articles have a predictable format

1.  Abstract
2.  Introduction
3.  Methods
4.  Results
5.  Discussion
6.  References

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Read the abstract

![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/knight_screenshot.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question: Do species interactions cross ecosystems

![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/fig1.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prediction

"We proposed that fish would reduce larval and adult dragonfly abundances and that this would permit a higher abundance of insect pollinators, thus indirectly increasing the pollination and reproductive success of nearby terrestrial plants."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How do fish affect dragonflies?

-   The study was done using 8 ponds at a study site in Florida
-   4 of the ponds had fish, 4 did not have fish
-   To measure the abundance of dragonfly larva, they put metal boxes in each of the ponds at 5 random locations to collect and count dragonflies. They also used sweep nets in the ponds.
-   To measure the abundance of dragonfly adults, had one observer count the number of dragonflies they saw in a 5 minute window. They made 2 counts at each pond.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/fig2.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/fig2_caption.png)

## Measuring pollinators

-   At each of the ponds, they measured the number of pollinators on St. John's Wort shrubs.
-   They watched each shrub for 20 minutes and counted the number of pollinator visits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/fig3.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dragonfly predation

-   They measured the direct effect of dragonflies on the pollinators.
-   They built cages around the shrubs. In some, they added a dragonfly. In some, they did not.
-   The dragonflies could not escape, but pollinators could easily enter the cages.
-   They counted the number of pollinator visits in each cage over 30 minutes

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/cage_results.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Do their results support their prediction?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What does this mean?

"Understanding interactions across ecosystem types may be crucial for gauging the effects of anthropogenic environmental change. Deliberate introductions of fish by humans are ubiquitous through- out the world (for example for recreation or pest control)26,27. Our results reveal that such introductions might have cascading effects on adjacent terrestrial ecosystems."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is data?

::: incremental
-   Data is a collection of facts
-   Data can be *quantitative* or *qualitative*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](slide-images/tropic_cascades/fig3.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Two types of scientific tests

**Experimental studies**: A treatment is imposed on a group and the response is measured. Something is *manipulated*.

**Observational studies**: Groups are observed and measured by not manipulated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Replication gives more accurate representation of group

## ![](slide-images/replication1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Replication gives more accurate representation of group

![](slide-images/replication2.png){fig-align="center"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scientific variables

**The dependent variable** is the variable that is being measured or affected by the treatment

The **independent variable** is the variable that is changed or manipulated in the experiment.

## Class Activity: Paper Airplanes!

-   In 2 groups complete the paper airplane activity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## For next week:

-   Introduce yourself on the class Google Chat
-   Make an account on Posit Cloud
-   Read the article on the Scientific Method
