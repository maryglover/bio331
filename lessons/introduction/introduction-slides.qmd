## What is science and the scientific method?

::: incremental
-   "Hypothesis testing"
-   Scientific inquiry uses well-established methods to test hypotheses.
-   A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a natural phenomenon.

## What is data?

::: incremental
-   Data is a collection of facts
-   Data can be *quantitative* or *qualitative*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Two types of scientific tests

**Experimental studies**: A treatment is imposed on a group and the response is measured. Something is *manipulated*.

**Observational studies**: Groups are observed and measured by not manipulated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question: How does drinking tea at night impact sleep?

**Experiment**: Split adults into two groups. One group drinks tea evyry night for a week and the other does not. Researchers measure the amount of sleep by both groups.

**Observation**: Adults answer questions about the amount of sleep they get and tea drinking habits.

## Question: How does sea level rise affect plants in the Chesapeake Bay?

## Scientific variables

**The dependent variable** is the variable that is being measured or affected by the treatment

The **independent variable** is the variable that is changed or manipulated in the experiment.

What are the dependent and independent variables in the tea and sea level rise studies?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Class activity: In groups of 3

1.  Come up with a research question.
2.  Form a hypothesis.
3.  Identify your independent and dependent variables
4.  Go collect data! (And record it!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Class activity

1.  How did you set up the table of your data observations?
2.  What do you think are the next steps with your data?
3.  What do you think is the best way to visualize or present your data on a graph or table? Draw it out.
4.  What are your results? Are the groups you measured different or do you see a relationship?
5.  Compare the results to your hypothesis
6.  What are you conclusions? Why do you think you got the results you did?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning objectives

**Analyze data in R**

-   Import data into R
-   Manipulate data into a format that can be analyzed
-   Calculate summary statistics
-   Determine the best type of graph to display data and plot figures
-   Test hypotheses with simple statistical tests
-   Interpret results and form conclusions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning objectives

**Communicate research and findings**

-   Communicate results to a scientific audience in written and spoken format
-   Design infographics of results to communicate with broad audiences
-   Create a scientific poster summarizing overall class research project

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning objectives

**Evaluate water quality**

-   Describe human activities that impact water quality in Wake County
-   Measure water quality with field and lab tests (nutrients, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH)
-   Identify aquatic invertebrate species and calculate a bioassessment index
-   Interpret data to evaluate overall water quality in local streams

## For next week:

-   Join and introduce yourself in the class slack

-   Download R and Rstudio on your computer

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Class activity

1.  Go to google sheets and record your data.
2.  Save your data as a csv file
3.  Share among your group
